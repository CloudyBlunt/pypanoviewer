### A panorama viewer written in Python! (kind of)


This is the first time I had to touch pygame, I was bored and wanted to try the panorama I just made with my DSLR, hopped on the internet just to find out that, there aren't that many good panorama viewers? For some reason, I thought that writing my own because I couldn't find the one I would like using was good idea.

It's very, very buggy, I mean, really buggy, the controls are wacky, the performance isn't great either, speaking of performance, I highly recommend you not to try importing large files, it takes ages (2 minutes to be precise) to load a regular 12000x6000 panorama image, just enough to make a coffee! 

As a piece of software it's useless, I just was bored, but if you're interested in using this code in one way or another feel free to steal it!

###### P.S. I haven't tested it on Windows, but I guess it should work
